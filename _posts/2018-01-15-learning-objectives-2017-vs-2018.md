Firstly, lets kick off with all of the things I learned last year. 2017 was a busy year in terms of finally nailing some JavaScript topics that I had been wanting to learn for a while. 

Learning React and Angular 2/4/5 were definitely two of the big ones. I feel like these are the top two JavaScript frameworks that dominate the Front End Developer/JavaScript job market at the moment with most of the emails I get from recruiters mentioning at least one if not both in any job they are trying to sell me on.

Improving my vanilla JavaScript and also finally jumping on ES6+ bandwagon was also a big one for me in 2017. I had been avoiding anything non ES5 for a while just because I thought some of the newer ES6 syntax just looked weird and complicated, however as time has gone on, it has become harder and harder to not write any ES6, so I finally took the plunge and I actually regret not doing it sooner.

## 2017
* ~~Promises (ES6)~~
* ~~Async/Await (ES7)~~
* ~~React~~
* ~~React Router~~
* ~~Redux~~
* ~~Angular 2/4/5~~
* ~~NodeJS~~
* ~~ExpressJS~~
* ~~MongoDB~~
* ~~Arrow functions (ES6)~~
* ~~Destructing Arrays/Objects (ES6)~~
* ~~Default Function Arguments (ES6)~~
* ~~Array Map, Filter Reduce (ES5)~~
* ~~Import/Export (ES6)~~
* ~~Classes (ES6)~~
* ~~Let/Const (ES6)~~
* ~~Rest/Spread (ES6)~~
* ~~Template Literals (ES6)~~

The top of my hit-list this year is GraphQL. I feel like it will eventually replace REST and I like the some of the basic concepts of it that I have heard so far e.g. the fact that you can specify exactly what data you want back from your API and therefore can have one endpoint for all the data instead of multiple endpoints for different parts.

Also, with JavaScript frameworks coming in an out of fashion over time, I think it would be useful to get my feet wet at least with some VueJS. It has been gaining a lot of traction recently and I predict that it will only gain more popularity in 2018.
