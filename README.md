# Personal Blog build with Jekyll

My personal _Jekyll_ powered Blog covering all things **Front End**.

The site is styled using `sass` with a `BEM` approach to naming conventions. The JavaScript is written in `ES6`, however is **not** currently being transpiled down to `ES5` using a tool like `Babel` so browser support may be a bit flaky.

If you would like to clone/fork this project, once you have a local version you can run the following command in the Terminal to get it up and running in a Browser:

```bash
jekyll serve
```
